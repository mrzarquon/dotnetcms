class dotnetcms::7zip {
  
  # This class makes use of the staging::file defined type in order to take
  # advantage of a centrally defined file staging directory. Specifically,
  # $staging::path. In Puppet at the time of writing, however, parse order is
  # important when it comes to defining and using variables. For this class to
  # work as expected, Class['staging'] needs to be parsed *before* this class
  # is. Because of how important this parse order is to expected behavior, a
  # warning will be issued on both the server and agent if this class is parsed
  # before Class['staging'] has been declared.
  #
  # Good: (assume Class['profile::staging'] declares Class['staging'])
  #
  #  include profile::staging
  #  include 7zip
  #
  # Bad:
  #
  #  include 7zip
  #  include profile::staging
